## How to Use:
- Create and activate your own MySQL, or create a connection to an already existing DB.
- Import the external jar file into your IDE
- Edit connection information inside the Driver.

## Something to note:
- Keeping connection information inside the driver file is a security hazard.
- Future projects, consider adding to gitignore or have a seperate manager for it. AWS Manager in the industry.
